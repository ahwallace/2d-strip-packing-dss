# A Decision Support System for the Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem

This repository contains a computerised, user-friendly decision support system for the two-dimensional strip packing problem. The work of this project is done by Aidan Wallace and Leslie Wu in partial fullment of the requirements for the degree of Honours in Statistics from the University of Cape Town.

## Two-dimensional strip packing problems (2D SPP)

The 2D SPP belong fundamental to the class of problems. This problem is concerned with finding a suitable arrangement of a set of two-dimensional rectangular objects to be packed into a strip of fixed width and unlimited height in a non-overlapping manner, such that the height of the packed objects is minimised.

These problems have widespread practical relevance in industries such as logistics (e.g., cargo packing) and manufacturing (e.g., trim loss) where resource efficiency is essential. In these applications, the goals of each activity are directly related; to produce good quality arrangements of items so as to maximise material utilisation is equivalent to minimising wastage.
