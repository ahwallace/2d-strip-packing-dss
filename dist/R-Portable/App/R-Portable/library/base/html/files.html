<h2>File Manipulation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions provide a low-level interface to the computer's
file system.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
file.create(..., showWarnings = TRUE)
file.exists(...)
file.remove(...)
file.rename(from, to)
file.append(file1, file2)
file.copy(from, to, overwrite = recursive, recursive = FALSE,
          copy.mode = TRUE, copy.date = FALSE)
file.symlink(from, to)
file.link(from, to)
Sys.junction(from, to)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>..., file1, file2</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vectors, containing file names or paths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>from, to</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vectors, containing file names or paths.
For <code>file.copy</code> and <code>file.symlink</code>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>...</code> arguments are concatenated to form one character
string: you can specify the files separately or as one vector.
All of these functions expand path names: see <code><a href="path.expand.html">path.expand</a></code>.
</p>
<p><code>file.create</code> creates files with the given names if they do not
already exist and truncates them if they do.  They are created with
the maximal read/write permissions allowed by the
&lsquo;<a href="files2.html">umask</a>&rsquo; setting (where relevant).  By default a warning
is given (with the reason) if the operation fails.
</p>
<p><code>file.exists</code> returns a logical vector indicating whether the
files named by its argument exist.  (Here &lsquo;exists&rsquo; is in the
sense of the system's <code>stat</code> call: a file will be reported as
existing only if you have the permissions needed by <code>stat</code>.
Existence can also be checked by <code><a href="file.access.html">file.access</a></code>, which
might use different permissions and so obtain a different result.
Note that the existence of a file does not imply that it is readable:
for that use <code><a href="file.access.html">file.access</a></code>.)  What constitutes a
&lsquo;file&rsquo; is system-dependent, but should include directories.
(However, directory names must not include a trailing backslash or
slash on Windows.)  Note that if the file is a symbolic link on a
Unix-alike, the result indicates if the link points to an actual file,
not just if the link exists.
Lastly, note the <em>different</em> function <code><a href="exists.html">exists</a></code> which
checks for existence of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> objects.
</p>
<p><code>file.remove</code> attempts to remove the files named in its argument.
On most Unix platforms &lsquo;file&rsquo; includes <em>empty</em>
directories, symbolic links, fifos and sockets.  On Windows,
&lsquo;file&rsquo; means a regular file and not, say, an empty directory.
</p>
<p><code>file.rename</code> attempts to rename files (and <code>from</code> and
<code>to</code> must be of the same length).  Where file permissions allow
this will overwrite an existing element of <code>to</code>.  This is subject
to the limitations of the OS's corresponding system call (see
something like <code>man 2 rename</code> on a Unix-alike): in particular
in the interpretation of &lsquo;file&rsquo;: most platforms will not rename
files from one file system to another.  <strong>NB:</strong> This means that
renaming a file from a temporary directory to the user's filespace or
during package installation will often fail.  (On Windows,
<code>file.rename</code> can rename files but not directories across
volumes.)  On platforms which allow directories to be renamed,
typically neither or both of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> must a
directory, and if <code>to</code> exists it must be an empty directory.
</p>
<p><code>file.append</code> attempts to append the files named by its
second argument to those named by its first.  The <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> subscript
recycling rule is used to align names given in vectors
of different lengths.
</p>
<p><code>file.copy</code> works in a similar way to <code>file.append</code> but with
the arguments in the natural order for copying.  Copying to existing
destination files is skipped unless <code>overwrite = TRUE</code>.  The
<code>to</code> argument can specify a single existing directory.  If
<code>copy.mode = TRUE</code> file read/write/execute permissions are copied
where possible, restricted by &lsquo;<a href="files2.html">umask</a>&rsquo;.  (On Windows this
applies only to files.)  Other security attributes such as ACLs are not
copied.  On a POSIX filesystem the targets of symbolic links will be
copied rather than the links themselves, and hard links are copied
separately.  Using <code>copy.date = TRUE</code> may or may not copy the
timestamp exactly (for example, fractional seconds may be omitted),
but is more likely to do so as from <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.4.0.
</p>
<p><code>file.symlink</code> and <code>file.link</code> make symbolic and hard links
on those file systems which support them.  For <code>file.symlink</code> the
<code>to</code> argument can specify a single existing directory.  (Unix and
macOS native filesystems support both.  Windows has hard links to
files on NTFS file systems and concepts related to symbolic links on
recent versions: see the section below on the Windows version of this
help page.  What happens on a FAT or SMB-mounted file system is OS-specific.)
</p>
<p>File arguments with a marked encoding (see <code><a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a></code> are
if possible translated to the native encoding, except on Windows where
Unicode file operations are used (so marking as UTF-8 can be used to
access file paths not in the native encoding on suitable file
systems).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>These functions return a logical vector indicating which
operation succeeded for each of the files attempted.  Using a missing
value for a file or path name will always be regarded as a failure.
</p>
<p>If <code>showWarnings = TRUE</code>, <code>file.create</code> will give a warning
for an unexpected failure.
</p>


<h3>Case-insensitive file systems</h3>

<p>Case-insensitive file systems are the norm on Windows and macOS,
but can be found on all OSes (for example a FAT-formatted USB drive is
probably case-insensitive).
</p>
<p>These functions will most likely match existing files regardless of case
on such file systems: however this is an OS function and it is
possible that file names might be mapped to upper or lower case.
</p>


<h3>Symbolic links on Windows</h3>

<p> Symbolic links in the sense of
POSIX file systems do not exist on Windows: however, NTFS file systems
support two similar concepts.
</p>
<p>There are &lsquo;junctions&rsquo; (or &lsquo;junction points&rsquo;),
unfortunately without a public API: a Windows version of the Unix
concept of mounting one directory on another. A junction can link
directories located on the same or different local volumes of the same
computer, but cannot link to a network drive. Function
<code>Sys.junction</code> creates one or more junctions: <code>to</code> should
either specify a single existing directory or a set of non-existent
file paths of the same length as <code>from</code>.  (Command
<code>mklink /J</code> can also be used to create junctions.)
</p>
<p>A version of symbolic linking to files/directories was implemented
more recently, and <code>file.symlink</code> makes use of that interface.
However, it has restrictions which are crippling.  First, the user
needs permission to make symbolic links, and that permission is not
normally granted except to Administrator accounts (note: not users
with Administrator rights): further many users report that whereas the
Policy Editor appears to be able to grant such rights, the API still
reports insufficient permissions.  Second, the interface needs to know
if <code>from</code> is a file or a directory (and it need not yet exist):
we have implemented this to allow linking from a directory only if it
currently exists.
</p>
<p>Care is needed with removing a junction (and most likely also a
symbolic link): many tools will remove the target and its contents.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Always check the return value of these functions when used in package
code.  This is especially important for <code>file.rename</code>, which has
OS-specific restrictions (and note that the session temporary
directory is commonly on a different file system from the working
directory): it is only portable to use <code>file.rename</code> to change
file name(s) within a single directory.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is no guarantee that these functions will handle Windows
relative paths of the form &lsquo;<span class="file">d:path</span>&rsquo;: try &lsquo;<span class="file">d:./path</span>&rsquo;
instead.  In particular, &lsquo;<span class="file">d:</span>&rsquo; is not recognized as a directory.
Nor are <span class="samp">\\?\</span> prefixes (and similar) supported.
</p>
<p>Most of these functions accept UTF-8 filepaths not valid in the
current locale.
</p>
<p>User error in supplying invalid file names (and note that &lsquo;<span class="file">foo/</span>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<span class="file">foo\</span>&rsquo; <em>are</em> invalid on Windows) has undefined consequences.
