<h2>Convert Integer Vectors to or from UTF-8-encoded Character Vectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Conversion of UTF-8 encoded character vectors to and from integer
vectors representing a UTF-32 encoding.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
utf8ToInt(x)
intToUtf8(x, multiple = FALSE, allow_surrogate_pairs = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>object to be converted.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multiple</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should the conversion be to a single
character string or multiple individual characters?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>allow_surrogate_pairs</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should interpretation of
surrogate pairs be attempted?  (See &lsquo;Details&rsquo;.)
Only supported for <code>multiple = FALSE</code> and in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.5.0 and later.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These will work in any locale, including on platforms that do not
otherwise support multi-byte character sets.
</p>
<p>Unicode defines a name and a number of all of the glyphs it
encompasses: the numbers are called <em>code points</em>: since RFC3629
they run from <code>0</code> to <code>0x10FFFF</code> (with about 12% being
assigned by version 10.0 of the Unicode standard).
</p>
<p><code>intToUtf8</code> does not by default handle surrogate pairs: inputs in
the surrogate ranges are mapped to <code>NA</code>.  They might occur if a
UTF-16 byte stream has been read as 2-byte integers (in the correct
byte order), in which case <code>allow_surrogate_pairs = TRUE</code> will
try to interpret them (with unmatched surrogate values still treated
as <code>NA</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>utf8ToInt</code> converts a length-one character string encoded in
UTF-8 to an integer vector of Unicode code points.
</p>
<p><code>intToUtf8</code> converts a numeric vector of Unicode code points
either (default) to a single character string or a character vector of
single characters. Non-integral numeric values are truncated to
integers.  For output to a single character string <code>0</code> is
silently omitted: otherwise <code>0</code> is mapped to <code>""</code>.  The
<code><a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a></code> of a non-<code>NA</code> return value is declared as
<code>"UTF-8"</code>.
</p>
<p>Invalid and <code>NA</code> inputs are mapped to <code>NA</code> output.
</p>


<h3>Validity</h3>

<p>Which code points are regarded as valid has changed over the lifetime
of UTF-8.  Originally all 32-bit unsigned integers were potentially
valid and could be converted to up to 6 bytes in UTF-8.  Since 2003 it
has been stated that there will never be valid code points larger than
<code>0x10FFFF</code>, and so valid UTF-8 encodings are never more than 4
bytes.
</p>
<p>The code points in the surrogate-pair range <code>0xD000</code> to
<code>0xDFFF</code> are prohibited in UTF-8 and so are regarded as invalid
by <code>utf8ToInt</code> and by default by <code>intToUtf8</code>.
</p>
<p>The position of &lsquo;noncharacters&rsquo; (notably <code>0xFFFE</code> and
<code>0xFFFF</code>) was clarified by &lsquo;Corrigendum 9&rsquo; in 2013.  These
are valid but will never be given an official interpretation.  (In some
earlier versions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> <code>utf8ToInt</code> treated them as invalid.)
