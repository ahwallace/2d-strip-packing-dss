<h2>Create a Class Definition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create  a class definition and return a generator function to create
objects from the class.  Typical usage will be
of the style:
</p>
<p><code>myClass &lt;- setClass("myClass", slots= ...., contains =....)</code>
</p>
<p>where the first argument is the name of the new class and, if supplied, the arguments    
<code>slots=</code> and <code>contains=</code> specify the slots
in the new class and existing classes from which the new class
should inherit.  Calls to <code>setClass()</code> are normally found in the
source of a package; when the package is loaded the class will be
defined in the package's namespace.  Assigning the generator
function with the name of the class is  convenient for users, but
not a requirement.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
setClass(Class, representation, prototype, contains=character(),
         validity, access, where, version, sealed, package,
         S3methods = FALSE, slots)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Class</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string name for the class.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>slots</code></td>
<td>
<p>  The names and classes for the slots in the new class.  This argument
must be supplied by name, <code>slots=</code>, in the call, for back compatibility
with other arguments no longer recommended.
</p>
<p>The argument must be  vector with a names attribute, the names being those of the slots in
the new class.  Each element of the vector specifies an
existing class; the corresponding slot must be from this class
or a subclass of it.  Usually, this is a character vector
naming the classes.  It's also legal for the elements of the
vector to be class representation objects, as returned by <code><a href="getClass.html">getClass</a></code>.
</p>
<p>As a limiting
case,  the argument may be an unnamed character
vector;  the elements are  taken as slot names and all slots have
the unrestricted class <code>"ANY"</code>. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>contains</code></td>
<td>
<p> A vector specifying existing classes from which
this class should inherit. The new class will have all the slots
of the superclasses, with the same requirements on the classes
of these slots.  This argument
must be supplied by name, <code>contains=</code>, in the call, for back compatibility
with other arguments no longer recommended.
</p>
<p>See the section &lsquo;Virtual Classes&rsquo; for the special
superclass  <code>"VIRTUAL"</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>prototype, where, validity, sealed, package</code></td>
<td>

<p><em>These arguments are currently allowed, but either they are unlikely to be
useful or there are modern alternatives that are preferred.</em>
</p>
<p><code>prototype</code>: supplies an object with the default
data for the slots in this class.  A more flexible approach is to
write a method for <code><a href="new.html">initialize</a>()</code>.
</p>
<p><code>where</code>: supplies an environment in which to store the definition.
Should not be used:  For calls to
<code>setClass()</code> appearing in the source code for a package the
definition will be stored in the namespace of the package.
</p>
<p><code>validity</code>: supplied a validity-checking method
for objects from this class.  For clearer code, use a separate
call to <code><a href="validObject.html">setValidity</a>()</code>.
</p>
<p><code>sealed</code>: if <code>TRUE</code>, the class definition will be sealed,
so that another call to <code>setClass</code> will fail on this class
name.  But the definition is automatically sealed after the
namespace is loaded, so explicit sealing it is not needed.
</p>
<p><code>package</code>: supplies an optional package name for the class, but
the class attribute should be  the package in which the class
definition is assigned, as it is by default.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>representation, access, version, S3methods </code></td>
<td>
<p><em>All these
arguments are deprecated from version 3.0.0 of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> and should be
avoided</em>.
</p>
<p><code>representation</code> is an argument inherited from S that
included both <code>slots</code> and <code>contains</code>, but the use of
the latter two arguments is clearer and recommended.
</p>
<p><code>access</code> and <code>version</code> are included for
historical compatibility with S-Plus, but ignored.
</p>
<p><code>S3methods</code> is a flag indicating that old-style methods
will be written involving this class; ignored now.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A generator function suitable for creating objects from the class is
returned, invisibly.  A call to this function generates a call to
<code><a href="new.html">new</a></code> for the class.  The call takes any number of arguments,
which will be passed on to the initialize method.  If no
<code>initialize</code> method is defined for the class or one of its
superclasses, the default method expects named arguments with the
name of one of the slots and unnamed arguments that are objects from
one of the contained classes.
</p>
<p>Typically the generator function is assigned the name of the class,
for programming clarity.  This is not a requirement and objects
from the class can also be generated directly from
<code><a href="new.html">new</a></code>.  The advantages of the generator function are a
slightly simpler and clearer call, and that the call will contain
the package name of the class (eliminating any ambiguity if two
classes from different packages have the same name).
</p>
<p>If the class is virtual, an attempt to generate an object  from
either the generator or <code>new()</code>
will result in an error.
</p>


<h3>Basic Use: Slots and Inheritance</h3>

<p>The two essential arguments other than the class name are
<code>slots</code> and <code>contains</code>, defining the explicit slots
and the inheritance (superclasses). Together, these arguments define
all the information in an object from this class; that is, the names
of all the slots and the classes required for each of them.
</p>
<p>The name of the class determines
which methods apply directly to objects from this class.  The
superclass information specifies which methods apply indirectly,
through inheritance.  See <a href="Methods_Details.html">Methods_Details</a> for inheritance in method
selection.
</p>
<p>The slots in a class definition will be the union of all the slots
specified directly by <code>slots</code> and all the slots in all
the contained classes.
There can only be one slot with a given name.
A class may override the definition of a slot with a given name, but
<em>only</em> if the newly specified class is a subclass of the
inherited one.
For example, if the contained class had a slot <code>a</code> with class
<code>"ANY"</code>, then a subclass could specify <code>a</code> with class
<code>"numeric"</code>,
but if the original specification for the slot was class
<code>"character"</code>, the new call to <code>setClass</code> would generate an error.
</p>
<p>Slot names <code>"class"</code> and <code>"Class"</code> are not allowed.
There are other slot names with a special meaning; these names start with
the <code>"."</code> character.  To be safe, you should define all of
your own slots with names starting with an alphabetic character.
</p>
<p>Some inherited classes will be treated specially&mdash;object types, S3
classes and a few special cases&mdash;whether inherited
directly or indirectly.  See the next three sections.
</p>


<h3>Virtual Classes</h3>

<p>Classes exist for which no actual objects can be created, the
<em>virtual</em> classes.
</p>
<p>The most common and useful form of virtual class is the <em>class
union</em>, a virtual class that is defined in a call to
<code><a href="setClassUnion.html">setClassUnion</a>()</code> rather than a call to
<code>setClass()</code>.
This call lists the <em>members</em> of the union&mdash;subclasses
that extend the new class.
Methods that are written with the class union in the signature
are eligible for use with objects from any of the member classes.
Class
unions can include as members classes whose
definition is otherwise sealed, including basic <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> data types.
</p>
<p>Calls to <code>setClass()</code> will also create a virtual class,
either when only the <code>Class</code> argument is supplied (no slots
or superclasses) or when the <code>contains=</code> argument includes
the special class name <code>"VIRTUAL"</code>.
</p>
<p>In the latter case, a
virtual class may include
slots to provide some common behavior without fully defining
the object&mdash;see the class <code><a href="TraceClasses.html">traceable</a></code> for an
example.
Note that  <code>"VIRTUAL"</code> does not carry over to subclasses; a
class that contains a virtual class is not itself automatically virtual.
</p>


<h3>Inheriting from Object Types</h3>

<p>In addition to containing other S4 classes, a class definition can
contain either an S3 class (see the next section) or a built-in R pseudo-class&mdash;one
of the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
object types or one of the special <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> pseudo-classes <code>"matrix"</code> and
<code>"array"</code>.
A class can contain at most one of the object types, directly or indirectly.
When it does, that contained class determines the &ldquo;data part&rdquo;
of the class.
This appears as a pseudo-slot, <code>".Data"</code> and can be treated as a
slot but actually determines
the type of objects from this slot.
</p>
<p>Objects from the new class try to inherit the built in
behavior of the contained type.
In the case of normal <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> data types, including vectors, functions and
expressions, the implementation is relatively straightforward.
For any object <code>x</code> from the class,
<code>typeof(x)</code> will be the contained basic type; and a special
pseudo-slot, <code>.Data</code>, will be shown with the corresponding class.
See the <code>"numWithId"</code> example below.
</p>
<p>Classes may also inherit from <code>"vector"</code>, <code>"matrix"</code> or
<code>"array"</code>.
The data part of these objects can be any vector data type.
</p>
<p>For an object from any class that does <em>not</em> contain one of these
types or classes,
<code>typeof(x)</code> will be <code>"S4"</code>.
</p>
<p>Some <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> data types do not behave normally, in the sense that they are
non-local references or other objects that are not duplicated.
Examples include those corresponding to classes <code>"environment"</code>, <code>"externalptr"</code>, and <code>"name"</code>.
These can not be the types for objects with user-defined
classes (either S4 or S3) because setting an attribute overwrites the
object in all contexts.
It is possible to define a class that inherits from such types,
through an indirect mechanism that stores the inherited object in a
reserved slot, <code>".xData"</code>.
See the
example for class <code>"stampedEnv"</code> below.
An object from such a class does <em>not</em> have a <code>".Data"</code> pseudo-slot.
</p>
<p>For most computations, these classes behave transparently as if they
inherited directly from the anomalous type.
S3 method dispatch and the relevant <code>as.</code><em>type</em><code>()</code>
functions should behave correctly, but code that uses the type of the
object directly will not.
For example, <code>as.environment(e1)</code> would work as expected with the
<code>"stampedEnv"</code> class, but <code>typeof(e1)</code> is <code>"S4"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Inheriting from S3 Classes</h3>

<p>Old-style S3 classes have no formal definition.  Objects are
&ldquo;from&rdquo; the class when their class attribute contains the
character string considered to be the class name.
</p>
<p>Using such classes with formal classes and methods is necessarily a
risky business, since there are no guarantees about the content of the
objects or about consistency of inherited methods.
Given that, it is still possible to define a class that inherits from
an S3 class, providing that class has been registered as an old class
(see <code><a href="setOldClass.html">setOldClass</a></code>).
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, both S3 and S4 method dispatch try to behave
sensibly with respect to inheritance in either system.
Given an S4 object, S3 method dispatch and the <code><a href="../../base/html/class.html">inherits</a></code>
function should use the S4 inheritance information.
Given an S3 object, an S4 generic function will dispatch S4 methods
using the S3 inheritance, provided that inheritance has been declared via
<code><a href="setOldClass.html">setOldClass</a></code>.  For details, see <code><a href="setOldClass.html">setOldClass</a></code>
and Section 10.8 of the reference.
</p>


<h3>Classes and Packages</h3>

<p>Class definitions normally belong to packages (but can be defined in
the  global environment as well, by evaluating the expression on the
command line or in a file sourced from the command line).
The corresponding package name is part of the class definition; that
is, part of the <code><a href="classRepresentation-class.html">classRepresentation</a></code> object holding that
definition.  Thus, two classes with the same name can exist in
different packages, for most purposes.
</p>
<p>When a class name is supplied for a slot or a superclass in a call to
<code>setClass</code>, a
corresponding class definition will be found, looking from the
namespace of the current package, assuming the call in question appears directly in the source for the
package, as it should to avoid ambiguity.
The  class definition
must be already defined in this package, in the imports directives of
the package's <code>DESCRIPTION</code> and
<code>NAMESPACE</code> files or in the basic classes defined by the methods package.
(The &lsquo;methods&rsquo; package must be included in the imports directives
for any package that uses
S4 methods and classes, to satisfy the
<code>"CMD check"</code> utility.)
</p>
<p>If a package imports two classes of the same name from separate packages, the <code><a href="getPackageName.html">packageSlot</a></code>
of the <code>name</code> argument needs to be set to the package name of the
particular class.
This should be a rare occurrence.
